| STRIDE Category | Example                                  | Impact                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Spoofing         | SIM Swap, Fake app login                | Unauthorized access to account      |
| Tampering        | App memory patching (Frida, Xposed)     | Business logic bypass               |
| Repudiation      | No secure logs in mobile app            | Deny fraud, legal gaps              |
| Info Disclosure  | Local storage in plaintext              | Leak of tokens, PII                 |
| DoS              | Crash via malformed inputs              | App downtime, poor UX               |
| Privilege Escalation | Root access via vulnerable componen
