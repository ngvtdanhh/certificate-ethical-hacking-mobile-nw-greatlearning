## 📝 Course Review

This course provides a strong foundation in ethical hacking, specifically targeting mobile platforms and telecom infrastructure. It blends theory with modern, relevant attack surfaces and includes defensive considerations.

✅ **What I liked**:
- Focused content on mobile security and telecom systems
- Easy-to-understand yet practical examples
- Great primer for anyone aiming for mobile Red Teaming

📌 **To Improve**:
- More hands-on labs or capture-the-flag (CTF)-style challenges
- Deeper Android/iOS app reverse engineering sections
